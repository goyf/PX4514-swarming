Initial literature review

The Chorus-line hypothesis of manoeuvre coordination in avian flocks by Wayne K. Potts 1984
-there is some kind of preliminary movement made by a "threshold" number of birds
-birds manoeuvre right when the "wave" approaches them
-reaction times increase in an exponential fashion

The Structure and Function of Fish Schools by Brian L. Partridge 1982
-fish are similar to birds but have a different "fleeing" behaviour
-fish use sight and lateral line, birds only sight
-fish are attacked directly by the predator and so they disperse into a sphere and then regroup
-birds get attacked only at the edges of the flock
	-> bird of prey should have some repulsion as well, perhaps a "threshold repulsion" to avoid collision

Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model by Craig W. Reynolds
-Rules for flocks
	1. Collision avoidance
	2. Velocity matching
	3. Flock centering

-Collision avoidance and velocity matching should be vector quantities that account for heading a speed
	-static collision avoidance establishes minimum separation distance and velocity matching maintains it
-Flock centering refers to local flocks of 3 or 4 birds
-It is important to figure out a way to arbitrage behaviour between boids
